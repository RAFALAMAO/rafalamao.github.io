As you can see, I usually play surf music, so, if you are interested in my pedals, guitar, strings, etc. You can review my guitar gear rig or equipment in this post, so... let's go.

## ⊙─ My Principal Guitar Specs ─⊙

I use a Cort G250 guitar with Mighty Mite coils, but humbucker pickups has a switch on the knob tone for change betwen single or humbucker.

### ❖ Guitar's Strings

My hands usually sweat a lot, thus I need a good anti rust strings and Elixir are de best for me, I use 0.10 - 0.46.

## ⊙─ My Principal Pedals ─⊙
I only use two pedals, a Digitech rp355 for overdrive, chorus and USB interface, also a SpringKing Reverb custom delay modified (I did the modification, I just followed [this tutorial](http://blog.utopianlabs.com/2017/04/danelectro-spring-king-delay-mod/) )
